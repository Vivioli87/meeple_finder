## Code Validation

Every page of the project was validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to ensure there were no syntax errors or issues.

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to validate CSS code.

[jshint.com](https://jshint.com/) was used to check JS code.

### W3C Markup Validation Service

Checked using both validate by direct input and validate by URI options.

#### Home page

JavaScript script link warning.

![home page - validation]()

## Functionality Testing

- Feature testing on each page in turn and for all screen sizes using the developer tools, my own personal devices and got friends/family to test also.

### Browser Testing

The website was tested on the following browser types. All browser versions were up to date.
- **Google chrome** - best performance with all cookies allowed.
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera (tested on ubuntu Linux)
- Samsung Internet
- Google chrome for Android 

The website does not work on Internet Explorer (javaScript does not function for some reason), please use Edge if you need to use a microsoft browser.

The website is functioning and fully responsive on all above mentioned browsers.

### Device Testing

For all my media queries, I used the following page for help on [standard device sizes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

The website was tested on the following devices:
- Windows laptop
- Samsung Galaxy A70

The site has been tested on friend's devices also. These include:


I have tested other devices using the chrome developer tools including:
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2 / Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5 / SE / 6 / 7 / 8 (incl Plus options) / X
- iPad / iPad Pro
- Surface duo
- Laptop

The website is platform-cross compatible and has a consistant result. However as noted on the main README doc, for the best user experience larger device sizes are recommended to be able to view cards without excessive scrolling on the gmaes/profile pages.
