## Overview

The purpose of this site is to act as Board Games Community where users can search for new board games based on various criteria and learn more about them based on user reviews. 

A registered user has access to their own profile page that contains a personalised collection and wishlist and can also leave reviews on games they have played to help other users.

## UX (User Experience)

The user types for this website would be for Board Game Fans (entry level or established) to find more Board Games that they would enjoy, 

### Visitor Stories
1. As a site visitor, I would like to search a list of board games based on different criteria e.g. number of players, game type, game manufactorer, age level etc.
2. As a site visitor, I would like to register an account that is secure and private.
3. As a site visitor, I would like a personalised dashboard to show board games I have in my collection, a wishlist for games I would like to have in my collection and reviews that I have made.
4. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to add reviews but also to edit and delete the reviews if required. I should also be the only user who can edit or delete my reviews, other users can only view them.
5. As a site visitor, I would like to be able to add or request to add a game to the board game list if it is not currently listed on the site.
6. As a site visitor, I would like to have games that are suggested to me based on the board games in my collection. (*potential future*)
7. As a site visitor, I would like to find board game retailers or cafe's where I can buy or try out new board games on my wishlist.  (*potential future*)
8. As a site visitor, I would like a website that is intuitive, easy to navigate and provides clear feedback on any actions I make (e.g when adding reviews, games etc)


### Business Stories
1. As a site owner, I would like to create a commuinty website where board game enthusiasts (new and old) can share their reviews and seek reccomendations on different board games.
2. As a site owner, I would like a site that's easy to navigate, is intuitive and has eye-catching design.
3. As a site owner, I would like for visitors to sign up to the community and add their reviews or reccomendations of board games to help fellow enthusiasts.
4. As a site owner, I would like adding reviews to be accessed by registered users only. Non registered users can only view board game listings and their reviews.
5. As a site owner, I would like users to be able to edit and/or delete their own reviews only.
6. As a site owner, I would like users to be able to add or request to add a game to the board game list if it is not currently listed on the site.
7. As a site owner, I would like to have admin access to be able to view, edit and delete any records that may be inappropriate for the website.
8. As a site owner, I would like to support local board games shops and cafes by having a google maps API for users to find shops/cafes local to them. (*potential future*)
